25/08/2017    v0.1 
 - along with python 2.7, the code is now Python 3 compatible
   (at least versions 3.4 through 3.6).
 - a replacement of lazyModule (lazy_module, which defers most work to
   _lazy_module) was implemented that uses a modified LazyModule class;
 - a different LazyModule class is now created per instance, so that
   reverting the __getattribute__ behavior can be done safely;
 - a function to lazily import module callables was added;
 - customization is fully supported, either as passable custom error messages
   or as passable LazyModule subclass alternatives.
 - module reloading is now more stable, especially in the case of submodules.
 - added testing.
